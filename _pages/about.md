Hi, my name is Raúl, also known as Vorkharium. I am a passionate Ethical Hacker specializing in Penetration Testing. I hold several industry certifications, including the HTB Certified Penetration Testing Specialist (CPTS) and the TCM Practical Network Penetration Tester (PNPT). My extensive experience in Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions includes successfully compromising over 150 targets in Hack The Box Labs and Offensive Security Playgrounds, achieving the HTB Elite Hacker rank.

In addition to my expertise in ethical hacking, I have over 9 years of experience working with industrial electrical, robotic and control systems. My skills encompass working with Human-Machine Interfaces (HMIs) and Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) using Siemens Step7 and TIA Portal, as well as ABB and KUKA Robots within one of the world’s largest automotive manufacturers.
